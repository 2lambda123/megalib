Generate and simulate an atmosphere model
=========================================

Step 1: Get the model
**************************

Go to this webpage:
> http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/models/nrlmsise00.php
and add the parameters of the atmosphere you want to simulate.

I used the following parameters:

Date: 2015, June, 13 (best Crab observation date)
Time: Local, 12 (Crab was close to the sun, so choose the time when the sun is highest, and Crab is visible the best
Latitude: -10
Longitude: -107 --> 252 deg (you can only add values between 0 & 360)
Height profile: 0, 200, 200 (i.e. 1 km bins)

Create model data in ASCII form

Independen variables: Height
Calculated MSIS Model Parameters: Mark all (although we will not need all of them)

Press submit, download, and save the data (I named it: Atmosphere.BestCrabDay.txt)


Step 1: Create a geomega mass model
**********************************

Use the small program AtmosphereModelCreator.cxx to create a geomega mass model out of the downloaded data
