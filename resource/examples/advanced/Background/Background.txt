How to generate a background for a NuSTAR-like orbit

(1)
The given trapped proton/electron and cosima proton/alpha particle files are for a NuSTAR-like orbit 
at launch time (altitude: 575 km, inclination: 6 degrees) 
Use SPENVIS to create new ones: https://spenvis.oma.be/

(2)
Compile the program BackgroundGenerator
> make

(3)
Run it (here: NuSTAR-like orbit)
> BackgroundGenerator -e 10 1000000000 -b 100 -o 575 6 12 -tps AverageTrappedProtonsElectronAP9Average.spenvis.txt -cps CosmicProtons.spenvis.txt -cas CosmicAlphas.spenvis.txt

See:
> BackgroundGenerator --help
for a list of the options

This will generate the cosima compatible source files.

(4)
To view the background spectra run:
> root -x BackgroundViewer.C

(5)
Setup the simulations:

One of the key files is Common.partial.source

Change the following line to yoy geometry:
Geometry             > You geometry here <

The other key files are 
- PhotonicComponents.source
- LeptonicComponents.source
- HadronicComponentsPrompt.source
- HadronicComponentsBuildUp.source
- HadronicComponentsDecay.source
- TrappedHadronicComponentsPrompt.source
- TrappedHadronicComponentsBuildUp.source
- TrappedHadronicComponentsDecay.source

(6)
Run the simulations

First run these files they are the primary particles, sorted by type (photons, leptons, hadrons): 
- PhotonicComponents.source
- LeptonicComponents.source
- HadronicComponentsPrompt.source
- TrappedHadronicComponentsPrompt.source
Usually you want to run multiple instances of each file to generate enough statistics.
You can use "mcosima" for this task

The hadronic components are just the first stage, i.e. the prompt interactions.
Beside the prompt particle interactions, they also generate a list of newly generated isotopes.
You have to use these files to calculate the build up after X years in orbit. 
The default is 1 year in orbit, if your want to change this, modify the *BuildUp* files.

Take another look at the content of one of these *BuildUp* files. There you will find a line:
> for i in `ls HadronicBackgroundIsotopes.p1.inc*.dat`; do echo "A.IsotopeProductionFile $i" >> HadronicBackgroundIsotopes.source; done
Execute this line in the directory where you ran your simulations, to generate a concatenation file "HadronicBackgroundIsotopes.source".

Then run the BuildUp source file. This is a few minutes run, which needs to be done with cosima, not mcosima.
At the end you have an isotope list with activities after 1 year in orbit.

Then you can run the third stage of thge hadron files, the *Decay* files. 
They simulate the radioactive decays due to activation build up.

Now you have all background components for you background analysis.
Remember to exclude the *prompt* trapped hadrons, if your instrument is OFF during SAA passages.
