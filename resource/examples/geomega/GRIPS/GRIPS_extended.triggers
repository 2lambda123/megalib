# Normal triggers requiring some kind of track and a calorimeter hit
# Remark: It is completely OK to set 0 instead of 0+ in the anti- coincidence system to reject events with hits in the anti-coincidence system. However, doing it this way makes it easier for later diagnostics, i.e. finding out how many events have been vetoed versus simply didnâ€™t trigger
